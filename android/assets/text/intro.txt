The two rival kingdoms of Freiboda and Letzniya*have always competed for military prowess, wealth, and territory.*
However, until a decade ago,*there had never been an actual conflict between them.*
That changed when young orphan prince*Tyran of Letzniya became of age to rule his country,*taking the place of the chamberlain*who had done so after the previous King's untimely death.*
It took an entire month to discover the spies...*By then it was too late.*Tyran knew near everything about Freiboda.*
Soldier count, emergency battle plans...*Everything that needed to be kept secret from other countries.*
The spies were found and executed,*but Tyran had received enough information; he declared war.*
It was a brutal slaughter.*Without a single strategy unknown to Letzniya,*Freiboda did not stand a chance.*
Once Letzniya took control of Freiboda*it imprisoned all of Freiboda's soldiers and set a curfew upon the country.*It is not hard to interpret that this*is their means of stifling a rebellion.*
However, little does Letzniya know*that it will take more than imprisonment to stifle the abhorrence toward it.*
A simple cell will not contain the ambitions of a revolutionary...*
